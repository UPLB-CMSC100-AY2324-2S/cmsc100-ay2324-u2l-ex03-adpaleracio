Code description: For this exercise, I used JavaScript to create a password validation program. The entered passwords should be matching, at least 8 characters long, and has a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, and a number.\
Key takeaways from this exercise:
- I learned that let, const, and var are all used for variable declaration but they are different in terms of scoping. Var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped.
